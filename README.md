# Flash Rhythm Engine (Friday Night Funkin')
Hello! Welcome to the Flash Rhythm Engine for Friday Night Funkin', this is currently in development due to the engine not being finished yet. (Duh)
# Compilation errors
Well, here's the weird thing, the folders HAVE to have lowercase letters first. I did change one folder to have a lowercase letter, however, GitHub didn't make it so for some weird reason.
So yea, rename "FREngine" to "frEngine".
This also might be why building Linux isn't working, GitHub needs to fix that.
